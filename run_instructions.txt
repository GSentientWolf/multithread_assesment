# install packages
pipenv install -r requirements.txt

# Enter the virtual environment
pipenv shell

# Execute the following command inside the virtual environment:
(env)> python -m main

It should execute a setting up sequence for the threading objects
and then execute for 40 s.

There should be a file named "file_repo.txt" in the same directory
as main.py. The file contains all the different sensors readouts.

Notes:
======
All sensors have different execution intervals.
All sensors are created via a Factory function.
The threading is synchronized using the logger class.
The network is a thread safe Queue.
Save to file works fine.
Save to a relational DB is still incomplete. Don't use it yet.
